# NGD Seattle Persistence Library

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/NGDSeattle/Public/_apis/build/status/ngdseattle.neo-persistence?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/NGDSeattle/Public/_build/latest?definitionId=33&branchName=master)

This repo contains the Neo3 versions of RocksDBStore and CheckpointStore used in
[Neo-Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express) and
[Neo-debugger](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-debugger). Eventually, these
classes are expected to move into an official
[Neo project repo](https://github.com/neo-project/).
